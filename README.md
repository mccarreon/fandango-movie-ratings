# Analyzing Fandango Movie Ratings

This project analyzed Fandango's movie ratings before and after Walt Hickey's initial analysis. Hickey found that Fandango ratings had a bias compared to other sites and it was incorrectly rounding stars up to the nearest half star value. This caused 4.1 rated movies to become 4.5. This analysis determined if Fandango fixed their system.
